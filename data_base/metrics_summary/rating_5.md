### 1. Correctness

#### Rating Scale
- **1 - Very Poor**: The requirement is invalid, describing a function or need that is infeasible, erroneous, or inconsistent with established domain knowledge.
- **2 - Poor**: The requirement contains significant inaccuracies, errors, or misalignments with technical feasibility or domain standards.
- **3 - Average**: The requirement is mostly valid but has minor technical errors, feasibility concerns, or unclear assumptions.
- **4 - Good**: The requirement is valid, technically feasible, and aligns well with established standards, with only minor areas for improvement.
- **5 - Excellent**: The requirement is completely valid, technically sound, and fully aligned with domain standards or commonly accepted principles.

### 2. Unambiguity

#### Rating Scale
- **1 - Very Poor**: The requirement is highly ambiguous and open to multiple conflicting interpretations.
- **2 - Poor**: The requirement includes substantial vagueness, unclear phrasing, or subjective terminology that causes significant confusion.
- **3 - Average**: The requirement is generally understandable but includes minor ambiguities or subjective terms that could cause varying interpretations.
- **4 - Good**: The requirement is mostly clear and allows for only one reasonable interpretation, with minimal room for confusion.
- **5 - Excellent**: The requirement is written in completely clear, precise language, ensuring a single, universally understood interpretation.

### 3. Completeness

#### Rating Scale
- **1 - Very Poor**: The requirement lacks critical details, omitting essential inputs, outputs, conditions, or constraints necessary for understanding.
- **2 - Poor**: The requirement is missing substantial details, leaving significant gaps in understanding its intended functionality.
- **3 - Average**: The requirement provides most of the necessary information but lacks some details, such as conditions or edge cases.
- **4 - Good**: The requirement is mostly complete, covering the majority of necessary details, with minor improvements needed for clarity.
- **5 - Excellent**: The requirement is fully complete, including all necessary inputs, outputs, conditions, and constraints, leaving no gaps in understanding.

### 4. Consistency

#### Rating Scale
- **1 - Very Poor**: The requirement contains internal contradictions, inconsistent terminology, or logically conflicting statements.
- **2 - Poor**: The requirement has significant inconsistencies or logical incompatibilities that undermine its clarity and coherence.
- **3 - Average**: The requirement is mostly consistent but includes minor inconsistencies in terminology or logical flow.
- **4 - Good**: The requirement is coherent and logically consistent, with only minimal deviations in terminology or details.
- **5 - Excellent**: The requirement is entirely consistent, maintaining logical coherence, aligned terminology, and uniform levels of detail throughout.

### 5. Precision

#### Rating Scale
- **1 - Very Poor**: The requirement is highly imprecise, lacking exact values, units, or tolerances where necessary, and includes excessive redundancy.
- **2 - Poor**: The requirement has significant imprecision, with vague or generalized terms and missing critical numerical details or units.
- **3 - Average**: The requirement is moderately precise but includes some redundant information or lacks specific tolerances, constraints, or numerical values.
- **4 - Good**: The requirement is precise, specifying exact values or constraints where necessary, with only minimal redundancy.
- **5 - Excellent**: The requirement is highly precise, avoiding unnecessary elaboration, while providing exact values, units, tolerances, or constraints where applicable.

### 6. Verifiability

#### Rating Scale
- **1 - Very Poor**: The requirement cannot be objectively tested, measured, or verified in any practical manner.
- **2 - Poor**: The requirement lacks measurable success criteria, making verification difficult or subjective.
- **3 - Average**: The requirement is generally verifiable but lacks clarity on acceptance criteria or verification methods.
- **4 - Good**: The requirement is mostly verifiable, with clear success criteria and feasible verification methods, though minor improvements are possible.
- **5 - Excellent**: The requirement is fully verifiable, with explicit, measurable success criteria and clearly defined verification methods (e.g., inspection, testing, analysis).

### 7. Atomicity

#### Rating Scale
- **1 - Very Poor**: The requirement addresses multiple unrelated functionalities, needs, or constraints in a single statement.
- **2 - Poor**: The requirement includes compound statements or objectives, making it difficult to address or test independently.
- **3 - Average**: The requirement is mostly atomic but includes minor compound phrasing or multiple related objectives.
- **4 - Good**: The requirement is nearly atomic, describing a single functionality or constraint with minimal overlap or secondary objectives.
- **5 - Excellent**: The requirement is entirely atomic, focusing on a single distinct functionality, need, or constraint with no compound statements.
