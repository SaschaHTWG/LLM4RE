### 1. Correctness
#### Rating Scale
- **1**: The requirement is incorrect, impractical, or misaligned with system goals; it contains errors or contradicts established domain knowledge.
- **2**: The requirement is partially aligned with system goals, but its feasibility or correctness is unclear or partially justified.
- **3**: The requirement is fully aligned, technically feasible, and consistent with domain knowledge.

### 2. Unambiguity
#### Rating Scale
- **1**: The requirement is unclear or open to multiple interpretations, with vague or subjective language.
- **2**: The requirement is mostly clear, but minor ambiguities or inconsistencies remain.
- **3**: The requirement is entirely clear, with no room for misinterpretation or subjective understanding.

### 3. Completeness
#### Rating Scale
- **1**: Critical details are missing, and the requirement cannot be fully understood or implemented.
- **2**: Most necessary details are present, but minor omissions reduce the completeness of the requirement.
- **3**: All necessary details are included, covering conditions, constraints, and scenarios comprehensively.

### 4. Consistency
#### Rating Scale
- **1**: The requirement contains significant contradictions, inconsistencies, or shifts in detail or terminology.
- **2**: The requirement is mostly consistent, but minor issues or variations in detail or terminology exist.
- **3**: The requirement is fully consistent, with coherent logic and uniform terminology throughout.

### 5. Precision
#### Rating Scale
- **1**: The requirement lacks specificity, with vague or unclear values, tolerances, or constraints.
- **2**: The requirement provides specific details but lacks tolerances or units where applicable.
- **3**: The requirement is fully precise, with exact values, tolerances, and constraints clearly stated.

### 6. Verifiability
#### Rating Scale
- **1**: The requirement cannot be objectively tested or measured, with unclear success or acceptance criteria.
- **2**: The requirement is partially testable, but success criteria or verification methods lack clarity or specificity.
- **3**: The requirement is fully testable, with explicit success criteria and clear verification methods.

### 7. Atomicity
#### Rating Scale
- **1**: The requirement is not atomic, combining multiple functionalities or objectives into one statement.
- **2**: The requirement is mostly atomic, but minor dependencies or ambiguities reduce its focus.
- **3**: The requirement is fully atomic, defining a single, distinct functionality or constraint without dependencies.
