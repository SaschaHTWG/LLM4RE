Unambiguity is achieved through clear and understandable language, allowing for a single interpretation. Completeness is also well-covered, as the requirement includes necessary details such as font size, contrast ratio, and comprehensibility. Consistency is maintained through the use of specific values and units. Precision is evident in the specification of exact values and constraints. Verifiability is ensured by the objective criteria provided (e.g., 90% of viewers with 20/20 vision). Atomicity is respected as the requirement focuses on a single need (legibility of data). The only minor issue is the assumption of 'standard indoor lighting conditions,' which could be more precisely defined for absolute clarity."
