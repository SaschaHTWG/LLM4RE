The requirement does contain compound phrasing by mixing projection screen specifications with readability criteria, which slightly reduces its atomicity. However, the objectives are related, supporting the average rating. A minor discrepancy could be argued as the requirement, despite its compound nature, still focuses on a primary need (readability) with a specific constraint (90% of viewers on a 10x10 projection screen).",

It correctly identifies the compound nature of the requirement and acknowledges the related objectives.

The requirement is clear and understandable (Unambiguity), includes necessary details for the desired functionality (Completeness), and maintains internal coherence (Consistency). It also specifies exact values and constraints (Precision) and can be objectively tested (Verifiability). The requirement focuses on a single need (Atomicity) and avoids compound statements. However, minor improvements could be made to further enhance clarity and specificity, such as explicitly stating success criteria for the 90% readability threshold."
