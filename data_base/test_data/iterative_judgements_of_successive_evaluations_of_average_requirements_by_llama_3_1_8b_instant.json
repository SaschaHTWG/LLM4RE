It effectively addresses key criteria from the metric definition, such as the focus on a single functionality and the issue of compound statements. However, it could be improved by discussing how the compound statement affects the requirement's atomicity in more depth or by providing examples of how this might impact testing or implementation.",

                "comment": "The improved requirement aligns well with most metrics. It defines a genuine system function (Correctness), is technically feasible, and free from errors. The requirement is clear and understandable (Unambiguity), allowing for a single interpretation. It includes necessary details for understanding the desired functionality (Completeness) and is internally coherent (Consistency). The requirement specifies that the list of reason codes must be derived based on the type of transaction and the industry, which implies a level of precision. However, it could be further improved by explicitly stating how the derivation process works or what specific values or tolerances are acceptable (Precision), and by including more detailed success or acceptance criteria for verification (Verifiability). The requirement focuses on a single need (Atomicity), making it well-aligned with this metric. Overall, the improved requirement demonstrates a good level of alignment with the metrics, but minor adjustments could enhance its precision and verifiability."
