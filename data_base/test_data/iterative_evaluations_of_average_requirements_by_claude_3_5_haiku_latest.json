It describes a genuine system function that is consistent with standard business practices in transaction dispute resolution. The requirement demonstrates technical soundness by specifying that reason codes will be dynamically generated based on two key contextual factors: transaction type and merchant industry. The reference to \"business rules\" indicates a structured approach to generating these codes.\n\nThe requirement shows good technical correctness because:\n1. It defines a clear, specific system functionality\n2. The approach of deriving reason codes dynamically is technically achievable\n3. It aligns with standard practices in dispute management systems\n4. The requirement implies a rules-based, context-aware code generation mechanism\n\nThe only reason it's not a 5 is the slight lack of specificity about the exact mechanism of code derivation.",
