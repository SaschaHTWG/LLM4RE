The requirement, as stated, does not include compound statements or multiple objectives. The justification is misleading and does not address the actual issues with the requirement, such as its vagueness and lack of clarity.

It defines a genuine system function (Correctness), is written clearly and understandable (Unambiguity), includes necessary details (Completeness), and is internally coherent (Consistency). The requirement also specifies the need for a clear and concise display, which implies a level of precision. However, to achieve an 'Excellent' rating, the requirement could be further refined to include exact details on how the display should be formatted, what specific details are considered 'relevant,' and how the system will ensure that the information is verifiable and testable. Additionally, while the requirement seems to focus on a single need, ensuring it does not inadvertently introduce compound statements upon further specification is crucial."
