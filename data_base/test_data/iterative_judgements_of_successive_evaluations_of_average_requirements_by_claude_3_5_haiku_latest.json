The requirement lacks specificity regarding the mechanism of deriving reason codes, the expected number or type of reason codes, and any constraints on the derivation process, which are key aspects of precision. However, the requirement does specify that the list must be derived based on the type of transaction and the industry of the merchant, providing some level of detail. Thus, while the rating is generally appropriate, it could be argued that the requirement has some redeeming qualities that might push the rating slightly higher, but overall, the SLM's assessment is sound.",

It highlights the lack of specificity in the mechanism for deriving reason codes and the absence of expected outcomes or constraints, which are crucial for a precise requirement. The justification effectively supports the rating by focusing on the key aspects of precision as defined in the metric. The only area for improvement could be in providing more detail on how the requirement could be improved to achieve a higher level of precision, but overall, the justification is well-structured and effective.",

The requirement is generally verifiable as it specifies that the list of possible reason codes must be derived based on the type of transaction and the industry that the merchant belongs to, according to the business rules defined for the Disputes System. However, the justification mentions a lack of clear success criteria or specific testing methods for how 'accurately' the reason codes are generated, which supports the average rating. The only minor discrepancy is that the requirement does provide some basis for verification, suggesting it might lean slightly towards a 'Good' rating if more detailed testing methods were implied or if the business rules were explicitly linked to measurable outcomes.",

It correctly identifies that while the requirement does specify a basis for deriving reason codes, it lacks explicit, measurable success criteria and clear verification methods, which are crucial for full verifiability. The justification is clear, relevant, and effectively supports the chosen rating, with only minor room for improvement in terms of detailing how the business rules could be used to enhance verifiability.",

Additionally, it focuses on a single need (Atomicity). However, minor issues remain, such as the potential for subjective interpretation of 'unclassified' code and the lack of explicit success criteria for verification, preventing it from being rated as 'Excellent'."
