704,NFR,"There are no safety requirements with this application, other than any normal hazards of a mobile device.  The only hazard is a user using the device when they should not be, such as while driving."
705,NFR,The application must be able to link up with the INTERNAL system in order for users to properly log in and be identified.  This information must be kept secure.
706,NFR,"The primary attribute of this application will be usability given the large amounts of data and information that will be presented on such a small screen, as well as the users ability to input data into the device in a reasonable manner that should not be that much more difficult than if they were at an actual computer."

They should be able to modify the approximate appearance of the application. This means the colors, and GUI figures in the applications, but not the addition/deletion of GUI elements."
719,NFR,"Application will be extendable. This means that a skilled Java Android programmer should be able to easily add a new sub-application to insApption, and add a launcher to it in the main-application."
720,NFR,Users must be a Radford University student in order to access the automatic class schedule and assignment sharing features of this application Users can authenticate by logging in using their RU username and password.
721,NFR,Most functionality will not require network connectivity.  System components that require authentication through Radford University and network connectivity will function as long as the systems maintained by the University are available.
722,NFR,The development team will follow best practices for clean code and software modularity in order to make the application as maintainable as possible.
723,NFR,Users will be able to access this application on or off campus anytime on their mobile device without the need of an internet connection.

This family identifies the level of auditing, enumerates the types of events that shall be auditable by the TSF, and identifies the minimum set of audit related information that should be provided within various audit record types. The following extended requirement for the FAU class has been included in this ST because the operational environment is capable of providing security audit generation for TSF functions."
734,NFR,"Performance should not be an issue because all of our server queries involve small pieces of data. Changing screens will require very little computation and thus will occur very quickly. Server updates should only take a few seconds as long as the phone can maintain a steady signal. The cost-division algorithms used by in application will be highly efficient, taking only a fraction of a second to compute."
735,NFR,SplitPay will not affect data stored outside of its servers nor will it affect any other applications installed on the users phone. It cannot cause any damage to the phone or its internal components. The only potential safety concern associated with this application applies to virtually all handset apps: SplitPay should not be used while operating a vehicle or in any other situation where the users attention must be focused elsewhere.
736,NFR,"This application assumes that only the user or whoever he/she allows will have access to his/her Android handset. With that being said, only a Google email address is required to verify the identity of the user upon opening the app. Since it is not password protected, there is no method to authenticate the users identity. This could only pose a thread if a user has set up PayPal functionality, however any transaction involving real currency must be authorized and confirmed before becoming final. The PayPal API provides all of the security checks needed to ensure that no fraudulent transactions occur."
737,NFR,The graphical user interface of SplitPay is to be designed with usability as the first priority.

947,FR,"An error during this process means there was a problem parsing the sentence and creating the generic question. In this case, return a message such as Sorry, I didnt understand that."
948,FR,This unit will receive the output sentence from the Generic Question Construction unit as input (R4.2.1.3).
949,FR,This unit will generate a generic answer sentence using the input. (example: What time does $building close? becomes $building closes at $closetime.). This unit will output the generic answer sentence described
950,FR,"If there was an error here, then the unit failed to create a generic answer given a generic sentence. In this case, simply fallback to the error handling described in R4.4.2.1"
951,FR,This unit will receive as input a mapping from the Generic Question Construction unit
952,FR,This unit will receive as input a generic answer from the Generic Answer Construction unit
953,FR,This unit will query the database for data about the elements in the mapping
954,FR,This unit will replace the representations in the generic answer with data.
955,FR,"This unit will output the answer to the original question, as described in R4.4.1.3."
956,FR,"If querying the database did not provide an answer, the system will say that it does not have an answer and provide appropriate website link where the user could find the answer. Example message, I dont know when Rush Building closes, but here is the website of the building."
957,FR,"If the system could not find appropriate website associated with the question, the system will return a generic error message such as Sorry, I couldnt find an answer to that."
958,FR,A MySQL database will be used to store all information required to answer questions.
959,FR,"The database is populated by the information extraction unit before the rest of the system is available, so that all information is readilyaccessible."
960,FR,The database will use the generic representations from R4.2.2.1 as table names or column headers for easier retrieval of data.
961,FR,The database will be updated periodically and the API will be unavailable during the update.
962,FR,Structural data sources will have their data stored in our database
963,FR,"For data with enough structuring, web scraping will be used to programmatically extract all the data needed and store it in our database."
964,FR,"For totally unstructured information, AI libraries will be used to programmatically extract and store any information possible"
965,FR,"Data that is especially hard to extract, for whatever reason, will be manually extracted and added to the database by a developer."
966,FR,The GUI will have a textbox that will accept inputs from a keyboard.
967,FR,"Text box will originally contain a suggestive text question, to guide the user to the format of an appropriate question. "
968,FR,The GUI will have a Send button which sends text from the textbox to the API when clicked
969,FR,The GUI will have a chat window displaying questions sent to the system and responses from the API.
970,FR,"The chat window will contain all questions and answers from the current session, with a scroll bar if all messages cant fit on the screen."
971,FR,"If there is a network issue, the chat window will display an error message."
972,FR,There will be a designated phone number that users can send texts to. 
973,FR,"Texts sent to that number will be sent to the API, then the system will reply to the user with the answer as another text message."
974,FR,"If a question is not understood by our API, the system will send a text containing an example question after the text with the API response."
975,FR,Upon the USB being plugged in the system shall be able to be deployed and operational in less than 1 minute
976,FR,The system shall be able to handle 1000 customers logged in concurrently at the same time.
